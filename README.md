## Key Features & Benefits

### Dynamic Interest Rates & High-Precision Calculations

- **Multi‚ÄëSlope Interest Rate Model:**  
  Our rates adjust in real time based on market utilization. Whether you're borrowing or supplying, you always get fair, dynamic pricing with smooth transitions‚Äîno more one-size-fits-all rates!
- **High Precision with 27‚ÄëDecimal Basis Points:**  
  Our calculations use 27 asset_decimals for basis points (BP) to ensure every fraction of interest is accurately tracked, minimizing rounding errors and maximizing fairness. üìä

### E‚ÄëMode: Supercharged Borrowing Power

- **What is E‚ÄëMode?**  
  E‚ÄëMode unlocks higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios by allowing you to use collateral from a single risk category. When all your collateral is in the same category, you get more borrowing power‚Äîthink of it as a financial cheat code (the legal kind)! üòé
- **Why Use It:**
  - **Maximized Efficiency:** More collateral equals more borrowing power.
  - **Tailored Risk:** Enjoy lower liquidation thresholds and optimized risk parameters when you stay within your chosen risk category.

### Isolated & Siloed Markets: Risk Management Redefined

- **Isolated Markets:**  
  Each position can only use one type of collateral. This isolation ensures that if one asset's value drops, it affects only that position‚Äîkeeping your other positions safe and sound. üîí
- **Siloed Markets:**  
  Borrowing is confined to a single asset type per position, preventing cross-asset risk. This design helps to contain risk and simplifies your portfolio management.

### NFT-Based Account Positions: Your Financial Identity, Reinvented

- **Multiple Positions, One Wallet:**  
  With our NFT account implementation, you can have multiple positions‚Äîeach for a different asset and risk level‚Äîall managed in one secure wallet. Each position is completely isolated, so you can diversify without the fear of cross-contamination. üéüÔ∏è‚ú®
- **Trade, Transfer, or Customize:**  
  These NFT positions aren't just static records‚Äîthey're dynamic, tradable, and customizable digital assets that represent your financial identity on-chain.

### Robust Liquidation & Risk Protection Mechanisms

- **Smart Liquidation Algorithms:**  
  Our liquidation logic is designed to protect borrowers. Liquidations are executed only when necessary and are done proportionally across all collateral. This prevents one asset from being unfairly liquidated and ensures that liquidators pay just enough to restore a healthy position.
- **Dynamic Liquidation Bonus & Fees:**  
  Liquidation parameters adapt based on your health factor. The worse your position, the higher the bonus and fee adjustments, incentivizing prompt action without over-penalizing you. ‚öñÔ∏è
- **Proportional Collateral Seizure:**  
  Collateral is seized proportionally from all supplied assets‚Äînobody gets to pick which asset gets liquidated, ensuring balanced risk distribution across your portfolio.

### Flash Loans & Gas Efficiency: Fast & Frugal

- **Instant Flash Loans:**  
  Need liquidity in a flash? Our flash loan feature provides on-demand access to funds (with a fee) for rapid arbitrage or refinancing‚Äîno collateral required, as long as you return the funds within the same transaction. ‚ö°
- **Efficient Caching:**  
  Our innovative caching mechanism stores price feeds and state variables during transactions, reducing redundant external calls and saving you gas fees while maintaining real‚Äëtime data accuracy. ‚õΩüí°

# MultiversX Lending Protocol Network Configuration

This repository contains network-aware scripts for deploying and managing the MultiversX Lending Protocol across different networks (devnet, mainnet).

## Setup

1. Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

   - `jq` (JSON processor)
   - `mxpy` (MultiversX SDK)
   - `make` (optional, for using Makefile targets)

2. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x configs/script.sh
   ```

## Network Configuration

The system uses three types of configuration files:

1. **networks.json** - Contains network-specific settings:
   - Network endpoints (proxy, chain ID)
   - Contract addresses
   - Oracle addresses
   - Account token details
   - File paths for WASM binaries
   - Ledger configuration

2. **Network-specific market configs** - Contain market parameters:
   - Located in `configs/`
   - `devnet_market_configs.json` - Market configurations for devnet
   - `mainnet_market_configs.json` - Market configurations for mainnet

3. **E-Mode configuration** - Contains E-Mode categories and their settings:
   - Located in `configs/emodes.json`
   - Defines E-Mode categories per network
   - Specifies assets and their parameters for each category

## Usage


```bash
make <network> <command> [arguments]

# Examples:
make devnet createMarket EGLD
