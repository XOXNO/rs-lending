# MultiversX Lending Protocol - Liquidity Layer

This module implements the core liquidity pool mechanics for a single-asset lending protocol
built on the MultiversX blockchain. The protocol enables users to supply assets to earn interest
and borrow assets against collateral while maintaining system stability through advanced
mathematical models and risk management mechanisms.

## Core Protocol Features

### üè¶ **Liquidity Pool Operations**
- **Supply**: Deposit assets to earn interest through scaled supply tokens
- **Borrow**: Obtain loans against collateral with compound interest
- **Withdraw**: Redeem supply tokens for underlying assets plus interest
- **Repay**: Pay back borrowed amounts with automatic overpayment handling

### ‚ö° **Flash Loan System**
- **Atomic Borrowing**: Instant loans repaid within the same transaction
- **Arbitrage Support**: Enable complex DeFi strategies and liquidations
- **Fee Collection**: Generate protocol revenue from flash loan fees
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Secure external call handling

### üìà **Leveraged Strategies**
- **Strategy Creation**: Build leveraged positions with upfront fee collection
- **Position Management**: Track leveraged exposures with debt accumulation
- **Risk Control**: Ensure proper collateralization of strategy positions

### üõ°Ô∏è **Risk Management**
- **Bad Debt Socialization**: Immediate loss distribution to prevent supplier flight
- **Liquidation Support**: Collateral seizure with protocol fee collection
- **Dust Management**: Clean up economically unviable small positions

## Mathematical Foundation

### üìä **Scaled Amount System**
The protocol uses a scaled token system to track positions and interest accrual:

```rust
// Core scaling formulas:
scaled_amount = actual_amount / current_index
actual_amount = scaled_amount * current_index

// Interest accrual through index growth:
new_index = old_index * compound_factor
compound_factor = (1 + interest_rate)^time_delta
```

### üí∞ **Interest Rate Model**
Dynamic interest rates based on capital utilization:

```rust
// Utilization calculation:
utilization = total_borrowed_value / total_supplied_value

// Kinked interest rate model:
if utilization <= kink_point:
    borrow_rate = base_rate + (utilization * slope1)
else:
    borrow_rate = base_rate + (kink * slope1) + ((utilization - kink) * slope2)

// Supplier rate calculation:
deposit_rate = borrow_rate * utilization * (1 - reserve_factor)
```

### üîÑ **Revenue Distribution**
Protocol revenue sharing between suppliers and treasury:

```rust
// Interest distribution:
total_interest = borrowed_scaled * (new_borrow_index - old_borrow_index)
supplier_share = total_interest * (1 - reserve_factor)
protocol_share = total_interest * reserve_factor

// Supply index update:
new_supply_index = old_supply_index + (supplier_share / total_scaled_supplied)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bad Debt Handling**
Immediate loss socialization mechanism:

```rust
// Supply index reduction for bad debt:
loss_ratio = bad_debt_amount / total_supplied_value
new_supply_index = old_supply_index * (1 - loss_ratio)

// Each supplier's proportional loss:
supplier_loss = supplier_scaled_tokens * old_supply_index * loss_ratio
```

## Security Architecture

### üîí **Access Control**
- All functions restricted to `only_owner` (controller contract)
- Prevents direct user interaction with liquidity layer
- Ensures proper validation and authorization flows

### üõ°Ô∏è **Reentrancy Protection**
- Cache dropping before external calls in flash loans
- State synchronization before and after operations
- Atomic transaction requirements for flash loans

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Precision Management**
- RAY precision (27 decimals) for internal calculations
- Scaled amounts prevent rounding manipulation
- Half-up rounding for consistent behavior

### üéØ **Invariant Preservation**
- Global synchronization ensures accurate interest calculation
- Asset validation prevents wrong token operations
- Reserve validation maintains liquidity constraints

## Economic Model

### üíé **Revenue Sources**
1. **Interest Spread**: Reserve factor percentage of borrower interest
2. **Flash Loan Fees**: Fees on temporary liquidity provision
3. **Strategy Fees**: Upfront fees for leveraged position creation
4. **Liquidation Fees**: Fees collected during collateral liquidation
5. **Dust Seizure**: Small uneconomical position cleanup

### üìà **Growth Mechanisms**
- Supply index appreciation from borrower interest payments
- Compound interest accrual over time
- Automatic fee reinvestment through scaled token minting
- Revenue appreciation alongside supplier deposits

### ‚ö° **Stability Features**
- Immediate bad debt socialization prevents bank runs
- Dynamic interest rates maintain healthy utilization
- Reserve requirements ensure withdrawal capacity
- Minimum index floors prevent total value collapse

## Usage Patterns

### üë§ **For Suppliers**
```rust
// Earn interest on deposits
supply(position, price) -> Updated position with scaled tokens
withdraw(caller, amount, position, ...) -> Assets + accrued interest
```

### üí≥ **For Borrowers**
```rust
// Borrow against collateral
borrow(caller, amount, position, price) -> Debt position with interest
repay(caller, position, price) -> Reduced debt + overpayment refund
```

### üîÑ **For Arbitrageurs**
```rust
// Flash loan for atomic strategies
flash_loan(token, amount, target, endpoint, args, fees, price)
// Must repay loan + fees in same transaction
```

### üìä **For Integrators**
```rust
// View current pool state
get_capital_utilisation() -> Current utilization ratio
get_borrow_rate() -> Current APR for borrowers
get_deposit_rate() -> Current APY for suppliers
```

This lending protocol provides a robust, mathematically sound foundation for decentralized
lending with advanced features like flash loans, leveraged strategies, and sophisticated
risk management mechanisms.

    /// Traditional bad debt handling creates a race condition where rational suppliers

    /// to bear disproportionate losses. This mechanism prevents such dynamics.
    ///
    /// **Mathematical Process**:
    /// 1. **Current Debt Calculation**: `bad_debt = scaled_debt * current_borrow_index`

    /// 3. **Loss Ratio Calculation**: `loss_ratio = bad_debt / total_value`
    /// 4. **Supply Index Reduction**: `new_supply_index = old_supply_index * (1 - loss_ratio)`
