# Oracle Module: Secure & Efficient Price Discovery

## Overview

The **Oracle Module** is a mission-critical component of the MultiversX lending protocol, engineered to deliver **accurate, manipulation-resistant price data** through a sophisticated multi-layered protection system. The system implements a comprehensive **three-tier validation architecture** combining aggregator feeds, TWAP-based safe pricing, and derived token mechanisms to ensure maximum security and reliability.

### Core Architecture

The oracle system operates on three fundamental pillars:

1. **Multi-Source Validation**: Primary aggregator prices validated against TWAP-based safe prices
2. **Asymmetric Security Model**: Dangerous operations blocked during price anomalies while safe operations continue
3. **Mathematical Price Derivation**: Sophisticated formulas for LP tokens and liquid staking derivatives

### Security Framework

- **15-minute TWAP freshness requirements** for all price validations
- **Dual-tolerance system**: First tolerance (¬±2%) and last tolerance (¬±5%) for granular control
- **Anchor price validation** ensuring consistency between all price sources
- **Transaction-level caching strategy** for gas optimization without compromising security

## Technical Features

### Multi-Source Validation Architecture

The oracle implements a sophisticated **three-tier validation system** ensuring maximum price reliability:

#### 1. Aggregator Price Feeds (Primary)
- **Real-time market data** from off-chain price aggregators
- **Sub-second latency** for immediate market response
- **High-frequency updates** for active trading scenarios
- **Validation required** against safe price anchors before acceptance

#### 2. Safe Price Mechanism (TWAP-Based)
- **Time-Weighted Average Price** calculation over configurable intervals
- **15-minute minimum freshness requirement** for all TWAP data
- **XExchange Safe Price integration** for established trading pairs
- **Manipulation resistance** through temporal price averaging

#### 3. Derived Token Pricing
- **Mathematical derivation** for liquid staking derivatives (xEGLD, LEGLD, LXOXNO)
- **Exchange rate multiplication** from underlying staking contracts
- **Composite pricing models** for complex derivative tokens

### Dual-Tolerance Security System

The oracle employs a **granular tolerance checking mechanism** with two distinct thresholds:

#### First Tolerance (¬±2%)
- **Immediate validation** of aggregator prices against safe prices
- **High-sensitivity detection** of minor price anomalies
- **Early warning system** for potential market manipulation

#### Last Tolerance (¬±5%)
- **Final boundary check** before price rejection
- **Broader tolerance** for natural market volatility
- **Operational continuity** during normal market fluctuations

### Asymmetric Operation Control

Critical innovation in oracle security through **operational asymmetry**:

#### Dangerous Operations (Blocked During Anomalies)
- **Liquidations** - prevented during price uncertainty
- **Large borrowing operations** - restricted during volatility
- **High-leverage transactions** - blocked for user protection

#### Safe Operations (Always Allowed)
- **Standard repayments** - always permitted
- **Position monitoring** - continuous operation
- **Emergency withdrawals** - unrestricted access

### LP Token Pricing: Arda Formula Implementation

- **TWAP Protection:** Utilizes **Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)** from DEXs to prevent flash loan-based price manipulation.
- **Safe Price Mechanism (XExchange):** Employs XExchange‚Äôs **Safe Price** feature, a TWAP-based pricing method, to provide secure and stable price data.
- **Configurable Tolerances:** Allows setting **upper and lower bounds** for price fluctuations to ensure stability.

### üìä Liquidity Pool (LP) and LSD Token Pricing

- **LP Token Pricing:** Calculates prices for LP tokens based on **reserve ratios** and underlying asset prices.
  - Supports **XExchange, LXOXNO, and other DEX pools**.
  - Validates LP token prices against **TWAP data** for manipulation resistance.
- **LSD Token Pricing:** Computes prices for Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) tokens (e.g., xEGLD, LXOXNO) using their specific exchange rates or derived pricing mechanisms.
  - **xEGLD and LXOXNO** are distinct from LP tokens, treated as derivatives of staked assets.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Validation

- **Price Fluctuation Tolerance:** Prevents manipulation by enforcing **pre-configured tolerance ranges** for price deviations.
  - Short-term and long-term prices must remain within **upper and lower tolerance ratios**.
  - If prices deviate excessively, the system reverts to **safe prices** or halts operations if unsafe pricing is disallowed.
- **Failsafe Mechanisms:** Halts operations if multiple sources fail or prices deviate excessively, avoiding reliance on unreliable data.
- **Anchor Checks:** Validates real-time prices (e.g., aggregator prices) against **safe price anchors** (e.g., TWAP data) for consistency.

## Operational Safety Matrix

The oracle system implements a comprehensive **operational safety matrix** that categorizes all protocol operations based on risk level and price reliability requirements:

### Risk Classification System

| Operation Type | Risk Level | Price Accuracy Required | Action During Anomalies |
|----------------|------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Liquidations** | Very High | ¬±0.5% | Block completely |
| **Large Borrows (>$10k)** | High | ¬±1% | Block completely |
| **Standard Borrows** | Medium | ¬±2% | Allow with safe prices |
| **Repayments** | Low | ¬±5% | Always allow |
| **Position Queries** | Very Low | ¬±5% | Always allow |
| **Emergency Withdrawals** | None | N/A | Always allow |

### Price Deviation Response Protocol

#### Level 1: Minor Deviation (0-2%)
- **Action**: Continue normal operations
- **Price Source**: Primary aggregator with validation
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging

#### Level 2: Moderate Deviation (2-5%)
- **Action**: Block high-risk operations
- **Price Source**: Safe price (TWAP) mandatory
- **Monitoring**: Alert administrators

#### Level 3: Major Deviation (>5%)
- **Action**: Block all dangerous operations
- **Price Source**: Safe price only or halt
- **Monitoring**: Emergency protocols activated

### Anchor Price Validation

The system performs continuous **anchor price validation** between different price sources:

#### Validation Matrix
```
Primary_Aggregator_Price ‚Üê‚Üí Safe_Price_TWAP
       ‚Üì                           ‚Üì
   Deviation_Check_1         Deviation_Check_2
       ‚Üì                           ‚Üì
   ¬±2% Tolerance             ¬±5% Tolerance
```

#### Validation Logic
1. **Primary Check**: Aggregator price vs TWAP within ¬±2%
2. **Secondary Check**: If primary fails, check within ¬±5%
3. **Fallback**: Use TWAP if all checks fail
4. **Emergency**: Block operations if TWAP unavailable

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Prices Are Computed and Protected

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Price Retrieval Flow**

1. **Cache Check:**
   - Returns a valid price from the **transaction-level cache** if available.
2. **Oracle Query:**
   - Fetches price data from the configured **on-chain price oracle**, **aggregator**, or **DEX pair**.
3. **Primary Source Resolution:**
   - Computes prices directly for tokens with **direct EGLD pairs**.
   - Uses **recursive resolution** for tokens without direct pairs (e.g., `TOKEN-X ‚Üí TOKEN-Y ‚Üí EGLD`).
4. **TWAP & Safe Pricing Validation:**
   - Compares real-time prices with **TWAP data** to detect anomalies.
   - Falls back to **safe prices** (e.g., XExchange‚Äôs Safe Price) if deviations exceed tolerances.
5. **Final Price Selection:**
   - Selects the most **secure and reliable price** based on validation checks.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Pricing Methods**

The Oracle Module supports multiple pricing methods, each with tailored validation and protection:

#### **Aggregator Pricing (Off-Chain Pushed Prices)**

- **Description:** Retrieves real-time prices from **on-chain aggregators**.
- **Validation:**
  - Compares prices against **TWAP-based safe prices**.
  - Ensures prices stay within **tolerance ranges** relative to TWAP data.

  - Falls back to **safe prices** (e.g., TWAP) if aggregator prices deviate beyond tolerances.

#### **Safe Pricing (TWAP)**

- **Description:** Computes **Time-Weighted Average Prices** over configurable intervals (e.g., 10 minutes, 1 hour) via XExchange‚Äôs **Safe Price** mechanism.
- **Validation:**
  - Compares short-term TWAP (e.g., 10 minutes) against long-term TWAP (e.g., 1 hour).
  - Ensures prices stay within **pre-configured tolerance ranges**.
- **Protection:**
  - Uses **long-term TWAP** or halts operations if deviations are excessive and unsafe pricing is disallowed.

#### **Hybrid Pricing (Mix of Aggregator and TWAP)**

- **Description:** Combines **aggregator prices** and **TWAP data** for enhanced accuracy and security.
- **Validation:**
  - Validates aggregator prices against TWAP-based safe prices within **tolerance ranges**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ LP Token Pricing: Arda Formula Implementation**

#### Mathematical Framework
The oracle implements the sophisticated **Arda mathematical model** for LP token valuation:

```
Given:
- K = Ra √ó Rb (constant product)
- Pa, Pb = prices of tokens A and B
- Ra, Rb = reserves of tokens A and B

Calculations:
1. X' = ‚àö(K √ó Pb / Pa)
2. Y' = ‚àö(K √ó Pa / Pb)
3. LP_Value = (X' √ó Pa + Y' √ó Pb) / total_supply
```

#### Security Validations
- **Reserve ratio consistency** checks against historical patterns
- **Price correlation validation** between underlying assets
- **Total supply verification** against contract state
- **Temporal consistency** with historical LP valuations
- **Liquidity depth verification** to prevent manipulation

#### Protection Mechanisms
- **Multi-source validation**: Compare against TWAP data within tolerance ranges
- **Historical bounds checking**: Validate against 24h price ranges
- **Emergency fallback**: Use long-term TWAP LP prices if deviations excessive

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Derived Token Pricing: LSD Implementation**

#### Exchange Rate Multiplication Model
For liquid staking derivatives (xEGLD, LEGLD, LXOXNO):

```
Derived_Price = Base_Token_Price √ó Exchange_Rate

Where:
- Base_Token_Price = EGLD price from aggregator/safe price
- Exchange_Rate = Current rate from staking contract
- Validation = Cross-reference with market price (if available)
```

#### Supported Derivatives
- **xEGLD**: Maiar Exchange liquid staking derivative
- **LEGLD**: Liquid staking with custom exchange rates
- **LXOXNO**: XOXNO platform staking derivative

#### Validation Framework

## Recursive Price Resolution & Multi-Hop Pricing

### Advanced Pathfinding Algorithm

For tokens lacking direct EGLD pairs, the oracle implements sophisticated **multi-hop price discovery**:

#### Algorithm Overview
1. **Graph Construction**: Build liquidity graph from all available DEX pairs
2. **Path Discovery**: Identify optimal routes using Dijkstra-like algorithm
3. **Cost Evaluation**: Balance gas costs vs. price accuracy
4. **Liquidity Validation**: Ensure adequate depth at each hop
5. **Result Caching**: Store successful paths for future queries

#### Supported Path Types
```
Direct:     TOKEN ‚Üí EGLD
Single Hop: TOKEN ‚Üí USDC ‚Üí EGLD
Multi-Hop:  TOKEN ‚Üí INTERMEDIATE ‚Üí USDC ‚Üí EGLD
Complex:    TOKEN ‚Üí POOL_LP ‚Üí UNDERLYING ‚Üí EGLD
```

#### Path Selection Criteria
- **Liquidity depth**: Prefer paths with higher total liquidity
- **Price impact**: Minimize slippage across route
- **Gas efficiency**: Optimize for transaction costs
- **Reliability**: Weight historical path success rates

### Multi-Hop Security Measures

#### Validation at Each Hop
- **Individual pair validation**: Each hop validated separately
- **Cumulative deviation tracking**: Monitor total price impact
- **Liquidity threshold enforcement**: Minimum liquidity requirements
- **Temporal consistency**: Ensure price freshness across path

#### Anti-Manipulation Protections
- **Path diversity requirements**: Multiple viable routes required
- **Maximum hop limitations**: Prevent circular routing
- **Liquidity concentration limits**: Avoid over-reliance on single pools
- **Price correlation validation**: Ensure reasonable relationships

## Smart Contract Integration Architecture

- **Price Aggregators:** Fetches and validates real-time prices against TWAP data.
- **DEX Pairs:** Queries **XExchange, LXOXNO** for liquidity-based pricing with TWAP integration.
- **Safe Price Contracts (XExchange):** Uses XExchange‚Äôs **Safe Price** for TWAP-based pricing.
- **Staking Contracts:** Retrieves **exchange rates** for LSD token pricing (e.g., xEGLD, LXOXNO).
