## Attack Vector Protection Analysis

### 1. **Price Manipulation Attacks** âœ… **PREVENTED**

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- **15-minute TWAP**: Makes flash loan manipulation extremely expensive and impractical
- **Multi-source validation**: Aggregator vs DEX price cross-validation with tolerance bounds
- **Staleness checks**: Automatic rejection of outdated price data
- **Deviation thresholds**: Configurable bounds (Â±2% tight, Â±5% relaxed) prevent extreme movements
- **Unsafe operation blocking**: Dangerous operations (liquidation, borrow, withdraw) blocked during high price deviation
- **Safe operation allowance**: Supply/repay allowed even with price deviations (no exploit risk)

### 2. **Flash Loan Attacks** âœ… **PREVENTED**

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- **Reentrancy guards**: Prevent nested flash loan calls
- **State manipulation protection**: Borrowing disabled during flash loans
- **Cross-shard validation**: Ensures atomic execution within same shard
- **Interest synchronization**: Rates updated before operations to prevent temporal arbitrage
- **Built-in function blocking**: Prevents calling blockchain built-in functions in callbacks

### 3. **Liquidation Manipulation** âœ… **PREVENTED**

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- **Dynamic bonuses**: Variable rewards (2.5% to 15%) prevent artificial triggering
- **Health factor targeting**: Mathematical optimization prevents over-liquidation
- **Proportional seizure**: Cross-asset seizure based on weighted values prevents cherry-picking
- **Bad debt protection**: Automatic cleanup prevents protocol insolvency
- **Dutch auction mechanism**: Fair price discovery for liquidation bonuses

### 4. **Position Limit Circumvention** âœ… **PREVENTED**

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- **Individual validation**: Checks position count before single asset operations
- **Bulk validation**: Counts existing + new positions in transaction to prevent bulk circumvention
- **Gas optimization**: Prevents unliquidatable positions due to gas limits during liquidations
- **Governance control**: Configurable limits (default: 10 borrow + 10 supply per NFT)

### 5. **Mathematical Precision Attacks** âœ… **PREVENTED**

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- **RAY precision (10^27)**: Eliminates precision loss in compound calculations
- **Half-up rounding**: Consistent rounding prevents systematic bias exploitation
- **Overflow protection**: Built-in MultiversX BigUint safeguards
- **Precision scaling**: Proper decimal conversions throughout protocol

### 6. **Reentrancy Attacks** âœ… **PREVENTED**

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- **Flash loan guards**: Prevent nested flash loan calls
- **State synchronization**: Interest rates updated before operations
- **Cross-contract validation**: Secure liquidity pool interactions
- **Atomic operations**: Single-transaction state consistency

### 7. **Economic Attacks** âœ… **PREVENTED**

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- **Interest rate manipulation resistance**: Utilization-based models resistant to gaming
- **Supply/borrow caps**: Prevent market manipulation through over-supply or excessive borrowing
- **Isolated asset protection**: Debt ceilings limit exposure to risky assets
- **E-mode restrictions**: Efficiency mode only for correlated assets with proper validation

## Oracle Security Deep Dive

### Multi-Source Architecture Protection
**Price Source Diversity**:
- **DEX Prices**: 15-minute TWAP from xExchange and Onedx
- **External APIs**: Off-chain price feeds from aggregator with staleness validation
- **Tolerance validation**: Cross-source price deviation monitoring
- **Fallback systems**: Safe price mechanisms during oracle failures

**Manipulation Resistance**:
- **Attack cost**: TWAP manipulation requires sustained 15-minute capital commitment
- **Detection speed**: Real-time deviation monitoring with configurable thresholds
- **Economic disincentives**: Liquidators profit from correcting mispricings
- **Staleness protection**: Automatic rejection of feeds older than maximum age (300-900 seconds)

**Failure Resilience**:
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues with reduced functionality during partial failures
- **Emergency modes**: Safe price views maintain basic operations
- **Recovery procedures**: Automatic resumption when oracles restore

## Recent Security Enhancements

### Position Limits Implementation
**Purpose**: Gas optimization for liquidations to prevent unliquidatable positions  
**Configuration**: Governance-controlled limits (default: 10 borrow + 10 supply per NFT)  
**Bulk validation**: Prevents circumvention through multi-asset transactions  
**Security benefit**: Ensures all positions remain liquidatable within gas constraints

## Design Decisions & Risk Assessment

### Intentional Design Choices

**100% Withdrawal Allowance** - Expert users can withdraw to health factor = 1.0  
- **Rationale**: Maximum capital efficiency for sophisticated DeFi users
- **Mitigation**: UI caps regular users at 98% health factor for safety
- **Risk**: Immediate liquidation exposure from minor price movements
- **Acceptable**: Expert users understand and accept this risk profile

**Position Limits** - 10 borrow + 10 supply positions per NFT  
- **Purpose**: Prevent gas exhaustion during liquidations
- **Protection**: Bulk validation prevents circumvention attempts
- **Governance**: Configurable limits can be adjusted as needed

**Oracle Dependency** - Multi-source price feeds required for operations  
- **Risk**: Oracle failures could impact protocol operations
- **Mitigation**: Multi-source aggregation, TWAP protection, staleness checks
- **Fallback**: Safe price mechanisms maintain functionality during temporary failures
